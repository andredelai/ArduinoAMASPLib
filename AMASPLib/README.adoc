= AMASP Library for Arduino =

//AMASP is a very simple protocol based on four packet types to communication between a Master and a Slave computer.

This library implements the AMASP (ASCII Master/Slave Protocol) for Arduino boards, a simple way to exchange messages between two computers using serial communication.

AMASP is an open standard communication protocol that uses four different packet types:

MASTER -> SLAVE:

 MRP - Master Request Packet
 CEP - Communication Error Packet

SLAVE -> MASTER:

 SRP - Slave Response Packet 
 SIP - Slave Interruption Packet
 CEP - Communication Error Packet

The protocol is transparent to the user that only needs to use the AMASP Arduino Library functions to implement his own applications. Please, see the available examples codes.

The library is always in test and improvements, if you have any problem using it, please send a mail to the author (Spanish, Portuguese or English) adelai@gmail.com.

Contributors will be welcome!

Wants to develop an AMASP library to other platforms? Be my guest!
